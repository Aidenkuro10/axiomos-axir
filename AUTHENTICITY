AXIR was initiated and is maintained by Pierre Seck.  
I am not a computer science graduate â€” I learned the basics as an autodidact.  
AI assistants (e.g. ChatGPT) were used to speed up coding and documentation,  
but all design choices, integration, testing, and validation were done by me.  
This project is guided by my vision and responsibility as founder of Axiomos.
